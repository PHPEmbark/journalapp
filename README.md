# Example Journal Application

This is the example journal application for PHPEmbark

This branch contains the state of the practical application for the PHPEmbark Curriculum after a specific section lesson

Each branch provides a "snapshot" of the finished state at the end of each section and each lesson

The application attempts to show best practices for a beginning developer from learning "Hello World" to Application Architecture, all in about 8 hours.
